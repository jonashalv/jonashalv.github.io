# Jonas Halvorsen, PhD
I am a research scientist at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI). My research interests are federation of graph queries, automated reasoning, logic programing, and knowledge graphs. I did my PhD at the University of Oslo, with the thesis topic "Soundness and completeness of SPARQ query federation", and did my MSc in Artificial Intelligence (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) at the University of Edinburgh.
